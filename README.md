# Cloud-Hosted RESTful API for Product Management

This project demonstrates my ability to build and deploy a **Java (Spring Boot)** RESTful API integrated with a **MySQL** database, hosted on **AWS**. The API handles CRUD operations for managing product inventory and is designed for scalability, leveraging AWS services such as Elastic Beanstalk and RDS.

## Key Features

- **Cloud-Hosted API**: Deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, enabling automatic scaling, load balancing, and simplified cloud management.
- **Robust Data Management**: Utilizes **MySQL** on AWS RDS to store and manage product data, ensuring reliability and security.
- **Full CRUD Functionality**: Supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting product entries through RESTful API endpoints.
- **Performance Optimization**: Built with scalability and performance in mind, using AWS services and optimized API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- **Java (Spring Boot)** for building the RESTful API
- **MySQL** for relational database management (hosted on AWS RDS)
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** for API hosting and scaling
- **Postman** for testing API endpoints
- **Maven** for building and managing the project

## What I Learned

This project strengthened my skills in:
- **Cloud architecture**: I learned how to deploy an application on AWS, configuring EC2 instances, load balancers, and auto-scaling groups.
- **Backend development**: I deepened my understanding of building and optimizing RESTful APIs using Java and Spring Boot.
- **Database integration**: I gained experience in connecting a Java application to a cloud-hosted MySQL database and handling data securely.
- **AWS services**: I developed hands-on expertise with AWS services, particularly Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, and security group configuration.

## Project Highlights

- **Real-World Deployment**: The API was deployed to a live environment on AWS, demonstrating my ability to handle the complexities of cloud deployment and configuration.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built for scalability and reliability with AWS services, showcasing my understanding of modern cloud-based infrastructures.
- **API Testing**: All API endpoints were tested using Postman to ensure functionality, stability, and reliability in a production environment.

## Project Summary

This project highlights my ability to develop scalable, cloud-hosted applications using industry-standard tools and frameworks. It showcases my backend development skills, experience with AWS cloud services, and my capability to deliver robust solutions in real-world environments.
